# About  

Hi there. My name is Joe Norton, and I like to make things. (AND I SWEAR I HAVE NO AFFILIATION WITH THAT STINKIN' ANTIVIRUS)   

I'm pretty much completely changing careers and going indie game dev.  
 
This is where I'm going to share my work. I hope to create a portfolio here, most likely some of my games will be entirely free. Especially while I'm learning.  

If you really like, or really hate, anything I work on I'd love to hear about it. Just email it to my first name on this domain.  

Adios amigo.
